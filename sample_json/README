notes for folder reference{
    The JSON modeled here is meant as 2/3 stage in JSON compiling - after resource extraction from storage and waiting
    for info about playing players to be compiled onto final JSON. On the other hand, this JSON is being designed
    in a way, so resource extraction would be easy.

    Files in this folder are of 4 kinds:

    complete.json   - centralpiece, compact version of what aforementioned json is meant to look like
    *.json          - other .json files, are meant as sort of a classes - to be included into complete.json
    include.dart    - running include.dart will generate two composed .json files - one with and one without comment
    generated_*     - files to be used as templates and completed view of design

    running include.dart will generate two composed .json files - one with and one without comment

    @something in complete.json functions as include "something.json"
    $something is used only as human reference

    all notes and criticism are welcome in form of comments (both "//" and "/**/"), noncommented code should be modified
    only with care. If you wish to followup with discussion, then ideally with end your note with recognizable #signature
